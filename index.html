            <h1>What is this wesbite about?</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to index and organise all the different
                resources relating to genealogy that I have found or been provided with 
                over the years. With so many websites being out there, I wanted to try and
                centralise as much as I could to create a one stop spot for all you need.
                
                I have done my best to try and organise the different websites into country 
                specific categories to help you find what you might need better.

                If you come across a website or resource that you think should be listed here
                which isn't, please get in touch and I will add it in.</p>
                
                <p>To find the index of links please visit the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> section of the webiste, where 
                all the links wil be indexed into the relevant countries they link too</p>
